# astronaut-data


Beginner project to learn about handling a dataset using Python 3.

In this project, you will look at a dataset of astronauts and come to your own conclusions (as well as answer questions about the dataset). Over the course of this lesson, you will learn about the basics of Python while studying the astronauts that fly around the solar system.

## Difficulty Level:  BEGINNER

To understand this project, you need very little programming experience. You should be able to create variables, perform mathematical operations, and print values. You also should understand basic Python syntax, fundamental programming concepts (such as strings, integers, and floats) and how to count properly (start at 0).

## The Story

NASA is assembling a Dream Team to send to investigate Mars and they need YOUR help. First, familiarize yourself with the astronaut dataset by analyzing the data. Then, decide which factors are important to you when choosing who should be on the Dream Team. Choose wisely.

## What you will learn

In this project, you will learn MORE about:
* `for` loops
* Functions
* `if` statements
